# This is an app designed to allow reddit users to predict F1 qualifying order.

Some users from the Formula1 subreddit have repeatedly insisted that machine learning predictions of qualifying order are fundamentally wrong.

This site is meant to provide a quick way for a user to set the qualifying order and then if they do set the order, compare it to the AWS results. A score will also be provided to allow for a comparison based on how far off the average a person was.

This is meant to be rather simple intitially. Basic functionality exist from this first commit.
